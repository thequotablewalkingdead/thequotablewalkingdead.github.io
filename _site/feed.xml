				<title>Do Psychopaths Survive Better?</title>
				<link>/video/film-theory-psychos/</link>
				<pubDate>Mon, 17 Apr 2017 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The world of The Walking Dead is tough and brutal. When Rick’s Rangers aren’t fighting off hordes of walkers, they’re having to contend with sick and depraved individuals who seem to be surviving well in the apocalypse. After a while one begins to wonder if being a lunatic really is better than being sane and kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MatPat does some cool research on this topic as well as a one on one interview with the man himself, Robert Kirkman. Check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Glenn Returns To AMC TWD Season 8</title>
				<link>/news/header-glenn-season-8/</link>
				<pubDate>Sat, 15 Apr 2017 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I almost felt like curling up into a little ball in the corner waiting for it all to be over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we know this is all part of being a Walking Dead fan. While the show doesn’t follow all points in the comics, we knew it was very likely Glenn would die at Negan’s hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/abraham_dies.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Abraham sad&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; width=&quot;300px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah and Abraham dies too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abraham had a chance to appear in some choice scenes in the finale during Sasha’s flashbacks. Sadly Glenn did not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However Scott Gimple, one of writers as well as show runner eludes to some interesting tidbits regarding Glenn appearing on the show again. 
TVLine asked Gimple about Glenn and future appearances. Gimple’s reply, “certainly be possible”. He hinted that as Maggie’s pregnancy comes closer to an end, Glenn may appear stating 
that “I’d be silly to say it isn’t [a possibility].”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll be here hoping to see our friend a couple more times.&lt;/p&gt;
