I almost felt like curling up into a little ball in the corner waiting for it all to be over.

But we know this is all part of being a Walking Dead fan. While the show doesn't follow all points in the comics, we knew it was very likely Glenn would die at Negan's hands.

Oh yeah and Abraham dies too.

Abraham had a chance to appear in some choice scenes in the finale during Sasha's flashbacks. Sadly Glenn did not.

However Scott Gimple, one of writers as well as show runner eludes to some interesting tidbits regarding Glenn appearing on the show again. 
TVLine asked Gimple about Glenn and future appearances. Gimple's reply, "certainly be possible". He hinted that as Maggie's pregnancy comes closer to an end, Glenn may appear stating 
that "I’d be silly to say it isn’t [a possibility]."

We'll be here hoping to see our friend a couple more times.
