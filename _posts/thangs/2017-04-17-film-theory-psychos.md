The world of The Walking Dead is tough and brutal. When Rick’s Rangers aren’t fighting off hordes of walkers, they’re having to contend with sick and depraved individuals who seem to be surviving well in the apocalypse. After a while one begins to wonder if being a lunatic really is better than being sane and kind.

MatPat does some cool research on this topic as well as a one on one interview with the man himself, Robert Kirkman. Check it out.
